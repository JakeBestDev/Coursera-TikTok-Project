# Coursera-TikTok-Project-GOOGLE-ADVANCED-DATA-ANALYTICS
TikTok Project provided by Coursera for learning Data Analytics and Data Science concepts. 

*******************************************************************************
Unfortunately I was unaware that the Jypyter Notebook account associated with my 
projects was tied to my Coursera account and after I completed the course the projects 
become locked. 

I did save the courses .py files but there weâ€™re better ways to save these projects 
to github. Please observe my work and not the design at this time. I have other 
projects where I correct this mistake. 

Thank you for understanding and I hope you have a great day!
